# Druwo
Druwo is a stack based VM language written in rust. <br>
This is by no means efficient or usable for any actual coding projects.

<br>

### Todo:
- Add a syscall instruction
- Add a compiler from source code to a executable
- Add a converter from the executable format to the internal Instruction set
